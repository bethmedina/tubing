# README

This is a short and very simple app that makes a call out to an API endpoint to determine if the conditions are right for tubing down Boulder Creek.

## Things I would like to implement given more time:
* List the conditions on the page in red if they do not meet the standards for good tubing, and green if they do
* Tests
* Find a way to make the API call faster
